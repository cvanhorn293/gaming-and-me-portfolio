# MCC Portfolio Project

## [Website URL](https://cvanhorn293.github.io/gaming-and-me-portfolio/#/)

-   This is the portfolio website link. It uses a HashRouter for react to allow it to be on GitHub Pages, which is why the URL looks a little odd.

## [Figma Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/5Z5TaxzfymB82pId16UKdZ/Portfolio-Wireframe---MCC?node-id=4-11&t=AIfA9J86wTBRZQeM-1)

-   Find my Figma Wireframe here. You're able to open up the side menu and explore the different pages and how the entire wireframe was built when I was designing the site out.

## [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/5Z5TaxzfymB82pId16UKdZ/Portfolio-Wireframe---MCC?node-id=4-11&t=AIfA9J86wTBRZQeM-1)

-   A very simplified version of the site. This includes links for the navigation to the separate pages, and links to sections on other pages.

## [GitHub Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/cvanhorn293/projects/1/views/1)

-   Kanban board of the different tasks throughout the project as I was coding everything out. Helps keep me organized on which tasks I still needed to do, and what I wanted to do.
